CommandTools
============
CommandTools is a Minecraft Bukkit plugin allowing you to link any command to an item, and use it wherever you're looking at.

**This plugin is in a very early alpha stage ! It is known to be extremely buggy, and almost nothing is done yet.**
**In other words : use it at your own risks !**
