Opens a fancy container interface to allow you to manage the tools in your
inventory.
The GUI will contain all the tools you have. If you have too many tools to fit
in one container, the bottom row will have arrows instead of tools, allowing
you to navigate from page to page.

Taking a tool from the container will give you the tool, like when using the get
command.
Putting a tool back in the container will remove the tool from your inventory, 
like when using the remove command.
